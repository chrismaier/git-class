Git has a working directory, staging area, and the repository on the local system.

Git add moves or marks what should be put in the staging area.

Anything not in the staging area will not be committed to the repository.

# Set up the user name - use --global or --add
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set up the email address
git config --global email.address "your.email@address.com"


# The diff command by default compares whats in your working directory
# with the bits in your staging area
git diff

# If you want to compare the delta between staging and the repository
git diff HEAD
