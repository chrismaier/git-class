Git has a working directory, staging area, and the repository on the local system.

Git add moves or marks what should be put in the staging area.

Anything not in the staging area will not be committed to the repository.

# Set up the user name - use --global or --add
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set up the email address
git config --global email.address "your.email@address.com"


# The diff command by default compares whats in your working directory
# with the bits in your staging area
git diff

# If you want to compare the delta between staging and the repository
git diff HEAD

# If you want to change the previous commit
git commit --ammend

# ** git commit --amend only changes the previous commit / change
# The ammend option can not go back past the last change - one level of undo
# You would need to use the "rebase" command to go back more than 
#  the last change


# When you cloe a remote repository, git automatically links to the remote
# repo called "origin"

# git pull vs. git fetch

# You must establish a tracking branch first
git checkout -b {branch-name} {remote-repo-name}/{branch-name}

# Setting up a tracking branch allows a pull to automatically fetch and merge

# How to remove a remote repository
# - notice the colon : before the branch name
git push {remote-repo} :{branch-name}


# fetch vs. pull
# git fetch pulls all tracked items from a remote in to your repository so you
# can then do a merge - but no files are changed, and no merge operations are
# attempted.
# pull will actually bring down the changes AND try and merge with the current
# files - you will see merge confilcts immediately if they exist


# When you "oops" with git add .
# Sometimes you add a bunch of stuff that you didn't intend
# Maybe it was image files, compiled code, or whatever
# And you added a LOT of it....
# As long as you haven't committed, do the following:
# Update your .gitignore so it doesn't happen again ;)
# and run:
git reset
