# Git - an introductory how to
# (for those of us that don't get git)

# Topics covered:
# Basic layout of git directories and projects
# Fundamentals of how git operates
# Real-world scenarios when using git to interact with things like puppet 
#  and software projects
# Connecting to public github (or using Rackspace internal github)

# *** This period of instruction assumes you have the following: ***
# ***  a public github account (free) ***
# ***  basic *nix shell familiarity ***
# ***  access to a system with git already installed ***


# Topics NOT covered (or not covered in depth)
# Merging / resolving merge conflicts
# Managing branches and branching strategy
# Rebasing
# Squashing
# And a slew of oters...


# Basic layout of git directories and projects:
#
# Best thing to do is select a "master git directory"
# Something like "~/gitrepositories/" or "~/gitrepos/"
# So, from your home directory:
cd 
mkdir gitrepos
cd gitrepos

# Now, from this directory we will hang all of our projetcs 
# We create one directory for each project we want to work on
cd ~/gitrepos/
mkdir mytestproject
cd mytestproject

# At this point, we still dont have any git repos configured, lets configure one:
git init

# We now have a single git repo in our tree, but it may not be configured 
#  properly.  Lets backup a bit, and create another
cd ~/gitrepos/
mkdir newtestproject
cd newtestproject

# This is an un-initialized git project HOWEVER - lets check a few things:
# What do we currently have configured for our settings?
git config --list

# We must understand that git has three levels of configuration 
# In order of precedence:
# local repo config - current repo only (over-rides all other levels)
# example:
git config --local --list

# global config - "global" for the currently logged in user
#  - can be over-ridden by a local repo config
# example:
git config --global --list 


# system config - stored in /etc/gitconfig : probably requires root to modify
#  - can be over-ridden by either the user global settins or local repo
# example:
git config --system --list

# Configuration settings are name value pairs
# The attribute names are often represented with dots "." between words
# spaces are used as the assignment operator
# example:
user.name myuser
 
# We should set our username and email address or we will have problems 
#  with our remote repos - ssh authentication is uesd frequently, but
#  https auth can be used as well


git config --global user.name chrismaier
git config --global user.email chris.maier@rackspace.com
git config --global --list

# Now lets initialze the "newtestproject" with our updated values
# (you are still in the ~/gitrepos/newtestproject/ directory right?)
git init



# Basic git interworkings - local repos
#
# Essentially the way I personally make sense of git I imagine three buckets
# Bucket one: the repo directory
# Bucket two: the staging area
# Bucket three: the repo (or repo-db)

# Understading how your data / changes move through the system is important
# Once you understand these concepts, git will get easy ;)

# While the directory and files in it are straight forward, you must accept
#  the fact that git will sometimes change the files.
# Generally, the changes are intended, but depending on the command you run
#  you may actually modify or delete data that you did not intend.
# Git is fairly friendly about warning you in some cases before it modifies
#  data, not so much in others
# Git has some commands that will help you save your work like:
git stash 

# However, git stash can also befuddle and confound you, so use it with 
#  caution

# So, the buckets - what are they and how do they work?
# The file directories should be pretty straight forward
# These are files you are editing - your source code, config files etc.
# Git will do NOTHING with these files if you don't tell it to
# (you are still in the ~/gitrepos/newtestproject/ directory right?)
echo "Test data" >> test-file.txt

# Let's see what git thinks we have done:
git status

# Yeah, nothing - there are no files "staged" / no checksums to compare to
#  the data in the repo
# ** Notice git was nice enough to remind us what to do next
# So, how do we tell git we want it to pay attention to our file?
git add test-file.txt
git status

# So, we just told git to pay attention to "test-file.txt" and to perform
#  the initial checksum and store all that in the staging bucket
# There are lots of ways to add files to the tracking bucket
# The three I am most familiar with:
git add {file-name} # adds one file
git add *           # adds all files in the current directory
git add .           # adds all files AND directories

# The important thing to note is the difference between:
# git add * 
# and
# git add .
# The first one generally wont track any files in any sub-directories
# The second one will add everything from all directories recursively always

# So, if we think we "oops'd" and we want to remove that password file
#  that is staged and ready to be commited, we can un-stage /remove it
# Use git rm --cached {file-to-un-stage}

mkdir stuff
echo "More file data" >> ./stuff/another-file.txt
echo "password=secrete" >> password.txt

git add *
git status

# OOPS - added the password file, lets remove it
git rm --cached password.txt

mkdir morestuff
echo "Lots of bogus data here" >> ./morestuff/data.txt

git add .
git status 

# Damn, that password file is a PITA - lets remove it again and fix this
git rm --cached password.txt
echo "password.txt" >> .gitignore
git add .
git status 

# And, if you dont want to track the .gitignore file... ???
# You can have multiple .gitignore files some global and system wide
# To learn more about gitignore files:
#  https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files


# Ok, so we are finally happy with the files in our second bucket
# Time to actually commit the files to the version contronl system
# The quick way will be covered so we dont have to deal with editors
git commit -m "Some meaningful comments here"

# So, here is what we did:
# We created files in bucket one (the file system / directories)
# We calculated checksums and staged our files in bucket two
# We decided not to put the passwords in to the repo so we un-staged them
# We committed our files to the repo - aka bucket three



# So, we have essentially covered one of the practical git use cases
# We created a new project and put stuff in to version control.
#
# 0. Create a new repo on my system
#
# Other common use cases I have run across:
# 1. Take my new shiny repo and put it on github
# 2. Copy a repo from github to my machine to work on it (commit access)
# 3. Copy a repo from github to my machine to work on it (NO commit access)
# 4. Get interrupted while working on a shared repo and have to switch branches




# Ok, remember when I said there were like three buckets - I lied
# In order to accomplish item 1. from the list above, we have to add a new
#  bucket - a remote bucket.
# Remote buckets are your friend because they prevent hard drive crashes 
#  from wiping out your beautiful local git repo.
# Everything we have done so far has been on our local box. 
# It may be obvious, but is dangerous enough to repeat: 
# Your version control efforts thus far are still a single point of failure.
# While it is very convienent to develop on your system and without internet
#  connectivity, your data is only as durable as your hard drive or storage 
#  media where you put the files.
# To ensure our data is really robust, we need to put a copy on a remote server
# And we probably want to collaborate as well...

# So, how do we see what remote buckets we have ?
git remote -v

# The -v is important because without it you get a very abstract list
# (well, abstract IMO since the list is made up of alias')
# Right now, there isn't anything dispalyed - because we have not connected
#  to a remote repository yet
# This is where we need our github account
# Log in to github
# Create a new repo named mytestproject
# (the name doesn't have to match but makes it SOOO much easier to manage)
# example error:
# "error: src refspec master does not match any."
#
# *** IMPORTANT ***
# DO NOT initialized the repo or it will be a PITA to sync local w/ remote
# Have a close look at the next page on github - second option
# "Push an existing repository from the command line"
# Let's try it:

# Using the SSH version
# ** (you must have your SSH key configured) **
git remote add origin git@github.com:chrismaier/mytestrepo.git

# Using the HTTPS version (probably going to prompt for user/pass)
git remote add origin https://github.com/chrismaier/mytestrepo.git

# Once you have ONE of the above configured we can have another look
#  at the git remote command
git remote -v

# So, what if you want to be able to use BOTH SSH and HTTPS ?
# The "origin" is simply an alias
git remote add origin-https https://github.com/chrismaier/mytestrepo.git
git remote -v

# Add a "foo" alias:
git remote add foo https://github.com/chrismaier/mytestrepo.git
git remote -v

# You can add as many alias' as you want, but I don't recommend it


# Now we have an alias, but the data still was not sent to the remote location
git push -u origin master

# What we just did:
# We pushed the commited data from our local repo
# The data was pushed to the alias "origin"
# The alias origin is a pointer to our remote repo on github
# The data was pushed for code branch "master"

# Just to re-iterate, the alias "origin" while used often as a standard
#  is simply an arbitrary alias to the remote repository.
# We now have to deal with the concept of a branch 
# A branch is another arbitrary alias assigned to a code progress path
# The branch "master" is another convention, but you could just as easily
#  be working on branch "staging", "qe", "dev", "patch", "hotfix" etc.
# Eventually, all the individual code progress branches need to be consolidated
#  or merged - typically back in to branch master.
